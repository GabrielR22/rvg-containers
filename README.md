# rvg-containers

Welcome to rvg-containers, a fixed container repo with header only implementation.

This is a repo about fixed containers, it is made to be used in a game engine that I work and at the moment is very work in progress.

It's not made to follow any standards or how mostly code, I will try be the most consistent possible but will adapt as I need (and learn more).

I plan to move to a different build system (well we really not need a build system, but at the moment it's easier for me to test in this sandbox app) in the future (still need to learn them).

The main purpose is simple of use AND SPEED, memory usage might be a bit higher (not much). 
This containers focus is lower sized containers (10k-). 

Feel free to contact me on discord Rovug#1023 for anything about the containers.
